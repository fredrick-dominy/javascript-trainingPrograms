/**

 * You'll implement once, a function that takes another function
 * as an argument, and returns a new version of that function
 * that can only be called once.
 * Subsequent calls to the resulting function should have no effect
 * (and should return undefined).
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * logOnce = once(console.log)
 * logOnce("foo") // -> "foo"
 * logOnce("bar") // -> no effect
 *
 */

var once = function(fn) {

  // return a NEW version of fn that can only be called once.
